# UVC-DirectX-Zero-Copy-Low-Latency-GPU-Accelerated
A low-latency, zero-copy video pipeline for Windows using C++ and a hybrid DX11/DX12 architecture. It bypasses the CPU by capturing UVC NV12 frames directly to VRAM and utilizing the GPU's Video Engine for hardware-accelerated color conversion, optimized for real-time computer vision and security.
